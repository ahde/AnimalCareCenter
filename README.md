We have developed a front end web version of our sumbitted proposal from part 1. This is an interactive front- end and accompanying back-end database application to be used at an Animal Care facility. We were able to implement the majority of the functionality as described in our proposal and E-R diagram however there a few details that could be further improved we have listed below details from each html page as it relates to the administrator's workflow. As described in our proposal the application is intended to be used by an Animal Care faciity administrator who is onboarding a new customer and animal:

- sever.py is where our flask connected database is located

- login.html is where the administrator would input their username/id and password to log in to the system and have access to the database. We wanted to include a login feature and validation to further concretely make the application secure & functional. 

- addCustomer.html - The administrator would then go to addCustomer.html to onboard a new customer and input their basic data into the database. The requested inputs for this page are: First Name, Last Name, Phone, e-mail, Address information: Street, City, Zip code, State, Country.

- pets.html - After on boarding the customer the administrator would then input the information of the pet that is receiving care from the facility. The requested inputs for this are: Pet Name, Pet type, pet's day, month and year of birth.

- appt.html - Next the admin can schedule an appointment for the pet that that will be receiving care. The admin will be asked to select a date, physician/nurse, year and day. 

- drugs.html - allows the admin to monitor the animal patient's medicine and treatments

- doctors.html - allows the administrator to manage the animal's care provider: doctors and nurses

- billing.html - allows for the administrator to generate an invoice for the cost of services provided by the Animal Care Facility
